##Angular Routing Lab (WITH WINE!)

| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Explore Routing in Single Page Apps |
| Create route-specific view templates and controllers. |
| Create RESTful Index and Show routes for a Wine resource. |
 
In this lab we will be working with templates and routing in angular.

When a user goes to `/` they should see a list of wines (`wines#index`).
When a user goes to `/wines/:id` they should see a single wine (`wines#show`).

Our data (a list of wines) lives at the bottom of `app.js`. Eventually we will use AJAX to retrieve this so we can perform all CRUD operations, but for now it's hardcoded.

### Hash Parameters
<a href="#setup">Setup</a><br/>
<a href="#ng-route">ng-route</a><br/>
<a href="#wine-list-challenge">Wine List Challenge</a><br/>
<a href="#wine-show-challenge">Wine Show Challenge</a>

### Setup
* Clone this repo.
* **Make sure to `bower install`.**
* Note: We will need to run a local server once we start playing with routing.
    - In the application directory run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
    - Then open your browser to "localhost:8000" (or similar).

## ng-route
A Single Page App needs a way of responding to user navigation. In order to perform "frontend routing", we need a way to capture URL changes and respond to them. For example, if the user clicks on a link to "/wines/1414", we need our Angular application to know how to respond (what templates, controllers, and resources to use). What we *don't* want to happen is for the request to reach the server.

1. Include `angular-route`:
    * Run `bower install -s angular-route` in your terminal.
    * Go to `index.html` and uncomment the angular-route script.
    * Add an `ng-route` attribute to the `div` on `index.html#23`.
2. Configure your routes:
    * In `app.js`, we need to add the `ng-route` module:
        * `var app = angular.module('wineApp', ['ng-route']);`
    * Next, we need to add our first route:
        ``` javascript
            app.config(function($routeProvider){
              $routeProvider
                .when('/', {
                  template: 'Home!'
                })
            })
        ```
3. Fire up your server:
    * From your application directory, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
    * Then open your browser to "localhost:8000" (or similar).
    * You should see "Home!"

4. Use a template file instead of a string:
    * Change `template: 'Home!'` to `templateUrl: '/templates/wines-index.html`
    * Refresh, you should see the content of `/templates/wines-index.html`.

5. Set up a controller:
    * It's time to attach a template to a specific controller, all we have to do is modify our route so that it looks like this:
        ``` javascript
            app.config(function($routeProvider){
              $routeProvider
                .when('/', {
                  // template: 'Home!',
                  templateUrl: '/templates/wines-index.html',
                  controller: 'WinesIndexCtrl'
                })
            })
        ```
    * Now let's add a single value to `WineIndexCtrl` (in `app.js`):
        ``` javascript
            app.controller('WinesIndexCtrl', function($scope){
              console.log("Wine Index")
              $scope.hello = "wine index controller is working!"
            })
        ```
    * And update our template to include:
        - `{{hello}}`
    * When you refresh you should see: "wine index controller is working!"

### Wine List Challenge
Can you display a list of all the wines on the wines index page? (Start by using the mock data object called `ALL_WINES` at the bottom of `app.js`).

What directive would you use to loop through a list of wines?

Can you get it working using the `WineService`, without using `ALL_WINES` directly?
- How would you inject the `WineService` into `WineIndexCtrl`?
- How would you query *all* of the wines?

### HTML5 Mode
Add, or uncomment, the following in your route configuration so that we don't have to use the query hash for navigation:
``` javascript
    $locationProvider.html5Mode({
      enabled: true,
      requireBase: false
    });
```

Now instead of linking to `#/wines/1424` we can link to "/wines/1424".

### Wine Show Challege
To setup a `wines#show` route, we need to first figure out how to capture the id parameter in the URL.

For each of your wines on the `wines#index` page, let's add a link:
``` html
    <h5><a href="/wines/{{wine.id}}">{{wine.name}}</a></h5>
```

When a user navigates to `/wines/:id` we want to display the wine with the matching id!

First, update the route:

``` javascript
$routeProvider
  .when('/', {
    templateUrl: 'templates/index.html',
    controller: 'WinesIndexCtrl'
  })
  .when('/wines/:id', { // the "id" parameter 
    templateUrl: 'templates/show.html',
    controller: 'WinesShowCtrl'
  })
```

Next, we need to inject a new module into `WinesShowCtrl` called `$routeParams`:

``` javascript
app.controller('WinesShowCtrl', function ($scope, WineService, $routeParams) {
    console.log($routeParams.id);
});
```

Can you get it working now that you know how to grab the corret `id`? How would you display only that individual wine?

### Stretch: Prettify
Go crazy. Use Bootstrap to make a fancy index and show page, listing out all the wine info, and showing an image for each of them.

Here are some of the wine fields we have to work with:

``` json
{
    "id": 1429,
    "created_at": "2015-10-13T01:30:28.631Z",
    "updated_at": "2015-10-13T01:30:28.631Z",
    "name": "CHATEAU LE DOYENNE",
    "year": "2005",
    "grapes": "Merlot",
    "country": "France",
    "region": "Bordeaux",
    "price": 12,
    "description": "Though dense and chewy, this wine does not overpower with its finely balanced depth and structure. It is a truly luxurious experience for the senses.",
    "picture": "http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sandboxapi/le_doyenne.jpg"
}
```
